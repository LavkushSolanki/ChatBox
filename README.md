# ChatBox
## Steps for installation
1) <i> npm install </i>for downloading the node module folder.Run this code in both server and chatbox folder.
2) Must have installed expo in you phone.
3) Most important step that I have learned is that your phone and laptop should be connected with the same network and for running this on to your phone instead of api calls made with localhost you have to past the ip address of the network you are connected.
EX:- http://localhost:3000 if you are making an api call like this you have to write http://192.168.234.567:3000 (you networks ip address which you can get from the wifi settings)
4) <i> npm run start </i>.A QR code will come in the terminal.
5) Scan the code with the expo app installed in the phone and boom you app will start running in the phone.
